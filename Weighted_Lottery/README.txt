# Weighted Lottery

## Automated selection of vendors using normalised inverse relationship weighted values and specified constraint parameters. 

### How to use:
- You will need an up to date python environment installed on your computer.
- Git Clone or download the MAIN repo or this folder directly.
- I use Jupyter Labs Notebooks for my code development, however you do not need this to run the script.
    - If you run your python environment in the native console, navigate to this folder and run the Vendor_lottery.py script, you will need the VENDOR_CURATION_LOTTERY sample data in the same folder for the script to work.
    - If you use notebooks, you can either run the .py or the .ipynb file.
    - You will need to remember that you have the !pip install requirements installed (These are in the first cell of the ipynb file.)
